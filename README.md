## Introduction

AIBuildAI is an AI agent that automatically builds AI models. Given a task, it runs an agent loop that analyzes the problem, designs models, writes code to implement them, trains them, tunes hyperparameters, evaluates model performance, and iteratively improves the models. By automating the model development workflow, AIBuildAI reduces much of the manual effort required to build AI models.

## Quick Start

### Installation

AIBuildAI requires a **Linux x86_64** machine.

#### Free version

```bash
curl -L -O https://github.com/aibuildai/AI-Build-AI/releases/latest/download/aibuildai-linux-x86_64-v0.1.1.tar.gz
tar -xzf aibuildai-linux-x86_64-v0.1.1.tar.gz
cd aibuildai-linux-x86_64-v0.1.1
./install.sh
```

#### Pro version (AIBuildAI 2.0)

The Pro version delivers stronger performance than the Free version (see the [4/27/2026 News](#news) entry).

1. **Register and subscribe.** Create an account at [accounts.aibuildai.io/sign-up](https://accounts.aibuildai.io/sign-up). After signing in, go to the **Billing** section and switch to the **Pro plan** ($50 / month). Once payment is processed, your account will show an active Pro subscription.

2. **Download and install AIBuildAI 2.0.**

   ```bash
   curl -L -o aibuildai.tar.gz \
     https://github.com/aibuildai/AI-Build-AI/releases/download/v2.0.0/aibuildai-linux-x86_64-v2.0.0.tar.gz
   tar -xzf aibuildai.tar.gz
   cd aibuildai-linux-x86_64-v2.0.0
   ./install.sh
   ```

3. **Log in.** After installation, run:

   ```bash
   aibuildai login
   ```

   This prints a link you can open in your browser to grant permission with your Pro account. To verify your login status, run:

   ```bash
   aibuildai whoami
   ```

   The output should show an active Pro plan.

### Set up credentials

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

### Run

**Example task:** Predict the enzyme class of a protein from its amino acid sequence ([Yu et al., *Science* 2023](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf2465)).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aibuildai/AI-Build-AI.git && cd AI-Build-AI
aibuildai --task-name protein-ec-prediction \
  --data-dir data/protein-ec-prediction \
  --playground-dir /path/to/playground \
  --model claude-opus-4-6 \
  --max-agent-calls 8 \
  --run-budget-minutes 60 \
  --num-candidates 3 \
  --instruction "$(cat tasks/protein-ec-prediction.md)" \
  --pipeline-budget-minutes 90 \
  --no-form
```

AIBuildAI takes two key inputs: `--data-dir`, the path to the training data for the task, and `--instruction`, a natural-language description of the AI task to solve.


**Important:**

Run the command directly in your terminal. Do not wrap the command in a `.sh` or `.bash` script. Running it through a script may cause the TUI (Text User Interface) to crash.

### Results

#### Output directory

After a run completes, the output directory usually looks like (structure may slightly vary by task):

```
├── candidate_1/  candidate_2/  candidate_3/  # Auto-generated training scripts and model checkpoints
├── checkpoint.pth       # Best model checkpoint
├── inference.py         # Standalone inference script for the final model
├── submission.csv       # Test predictions (if test inputs are provided)
└── progress.pdf         # Visual progress report
```

The main outputs of an AIBuildAI run are the model checkpoints and the script `inference.py`, which runs predictions with the final model on any data.

#### Evaluation

In the example protein-ec-prediction task, we provide unlabeled test data in the data folder, so AIBuildAI also generates a predicted-label file `submission.csv`. To evaluate the predictions against ground-truth labels:

```bash
python scripts/eval_protein_ec.py \
  --labels data/labels/protein-ec-prediction.csv \
  --submission /path/to/playground/code/protein-ec-prediction/timestamp/submission.csv
```

### Other tasks

We provide additional task markdowns in the `tasks/` folder. You can also write your own task markdown and point `--data-dir` to your own dataset.

---

### Command line options

To see all available options, run:

```bash
aibuildai -h
```

### Interactive form mode 

Alternatively, you can run AIBuildAI using the interactive form interface by running without `--no-form`:

```bash
aibuildai
```

This will launch a TUI (Text User Interface) where you can fill in the required parameters interactively.
