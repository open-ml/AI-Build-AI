## Introduction

AIBuildAI is an AI agent that automatically builds AI models. Given a task, it runs an agent loop that analyzes the problem, designs models, writes code to implement them, trains them, tunes hyperparameters, evaluates model performance, and iteratively improves the models. By automating the model development workflow, AIBuildAI reduces much of the manual effort required to build AI models.

## Quick Start

AIBuildAI requires a **Linux x86_64** machine (Ubuntu 20.04 or newer).

There are three versions. **V2.5 (Max)** is the current, most capable version. **V2 (Pro)** and **V1 (free)** remain available.

| Version | Plan | To run it |
|---|---|---|
| **V2.5 (Max)** — current | Max subscription | `aibuildai login` (Max plan) + an Anthropic API key |
| **V2 (Pro)** | Pro subscription | `aibuildai login` (Pro plan) + an Anthropic API key |
| **V1** | free | an Anthropic API key (no account) |

Subscriptions are managed at [accounts.aibuildai.io](https://accounts.aibuildai.io); see the account page for the available plans.

### V2.5 (Max) — current

1. **Subscribe.** Create an account at [accounts.aibuildai.io/sign-up](https://accounts.aibuildai.io/sign-up) and switch to the **Max** plan.

2. **Install.**

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://github.com/aibuildai/AI-Build-AI/releases/download/v2.5-latest/aibuildai-linux-x86_64.tar.gz | tar xz && ./aibuildai-linux-x86_64-*/install.sh
   ```

3. **Log in** (required before running):

   ```bash
   aibuildai login      # opens a browser to sign in
   aibuildai whoami     # should show an active Max plan
   ```

4. **Set your Anthropic API key.**

   ```bash
   export AIBUILDAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```

5. **Run.** V2.5 is driven by a YAML config:

   ```bash
   aibuildai config > task.yaml    # writes a starter config with every field
   # edit task.yaml: set run.task_name, run.data_root, run.instruction, run.playground_root
   aibuildai run task.yaml
   ```

   Other commands: `aibuildai memorize` (summarize past runs into memory), `aibuildai replay <run-dir>` (replay a finished run), `aibuildai --help`.

### V2 (Pro)

1. **Subscribe** to the **Pro** plan at [accounts.aibuildai.io/sign-up](https://accounts.aibuildai.io/sign-up).

2. **Install.**

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://github.com/aibuildai/AI-Build-AI/releases/download/v2.0-latest/aibuildai-linux-x86_64.tar.gz | tar xz && ./aibuildai-linux-x86_64-*/install.sh
   ```

3. **Log in.**

   ```bash
   aibuildai login
   aibuildai whoami     # should show an active Pro plan
   ```

4. **Set credentials.**

   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```

5. **Run.** V2 is driven by command-line flags:

   ```bash
   aibuildai run --task-name <name> --data-dir <path> \
     --playground-dir <path> --instruction "$(cat task.md)" --no-form
   ```

   Or run `aibuildai` with no flags to fill in the parameters in an interactive form.

### V1 (free)

No account or subscription required.

1. **Install.**

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://github.com/aibuildai/AI-Build-AI/releases/download/v1.0-latest/aibuildai-linux-x86_64.tar.gz | tar xz && ./aibuildai-linux-x86_64-*/install.sh
   ```

2. **Set your Anthropic API key.**

   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```

3. **Run** with command-line flags:

   ```bash
   aibuildai --task-name <name> --data-dir <path> \
     --playground-dir <path> --instruction "$(cat task.md)" --no-form
   ```

   Or run `aibuildai` with no flags to fill in the parameters in an interactive form.

**Important:** run the command directly in your terminal. Do not wrap it in a `.sh`/`.bash` script — running it through a script may cause the TUI (Text User Interface) to crash.

### Results

After a run completes, the output directory usually looks like (structure may slightly vary by task):

```
├── candidate_1/  candidate_2/  candidate_3/  # Auto-generated training scripts and model checkpoints
├── checkpoint.pth       # Best model checkpoint
├── inference.py         # Standalone inference script for the final model
├── submission.csv       # Test predictions (if test inputs are provided)
└── progress.pdf         # Visual progress report
```

The main outputs of an AIBuildAI run are the model checkpoints and the script `inference.py`, which runs predictions with the final model on any data. When the task data folder includes unlabeled test inputs, AIBuildAI also writes a predicted-label file `submission.csv`.

### Tasks

We provide ready-to-run task markdowns and datasets in the `tasks/` folder of this repository. You can also write your own task description and point the run at your own dataset.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aibuildai/AI-Build-AI.git
```
